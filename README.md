# Pac³man – AI Agents for Pac-Man

Pac³man is an AI project built in Python where intelligent agents learn to play the classic Pac-Man game using core AI techniques.

The project includes:

- **Search algorithms**: DFS, BFS, A*, Uniform Cost
- **Adversarial agents**: Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Expectimax
- **Markov models**: n-gram text generator for sentence prediction
- **Autograding framework** for evaluating agent performance

Everything is implemented from scratch, without ML libraries, focusing on core logic and algorithm design.

## Run it locally

```bash
python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l mediumClassic -a depth=3
```

Replace `MinimaxAgent` with any of the implemented agents.
